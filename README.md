# Neural Netwok 

This is a neural network coded from scratch that classifies the MNIST handwritten digits. 

### Q1 
In Q1 I test the effect of different output formats, learning rates, batch sizes and ...

### Q2 
Q2 runs the code using the best features we tested in Q1 and it reaches **90% accuracy** !!

### Q3
The code in Q3 runs a model using only two layers (input and output, there is **no** hidden layer) on the same dataset and reaches **80% accuracy**. 

## How to run it ...
in order to run the code `cd` to the directory and run `python3 main.py`
